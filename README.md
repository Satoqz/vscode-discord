## Requirements

### [Discord desktop installation](https://discord.com/download)<p>
> **Linux users:** Note that discord versions installed using `flatpak` or `snap` need modifications in order to support IPC. 
> You are much better off installing discord from the official repositories of your linux distribution. ([Flatpak thread](https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.Discord/issues/29))
